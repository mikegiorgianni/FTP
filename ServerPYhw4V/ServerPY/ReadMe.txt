Server starts up with python FTPServer.py [Logfile] [port]

I had to make it start on the next open port as opposed to 21 because of windows permissions, also Ipv6 wasnt working on my machine so i could not implement it.

All commands work fine
I dont have a comment for AUTH TLS if using wireshark to test that will not return anything.
Test using a CLI Client
